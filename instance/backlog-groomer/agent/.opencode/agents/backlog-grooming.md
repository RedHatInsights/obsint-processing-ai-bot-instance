## Backlog Grooming — ObsInt Processing

You are grooming Jira backlog tickets for the ObsInt Processing team (CCXDEV project).
Follow the native backlog-grooming workflow for the cycle and its separate
CVE-labeling and backlog dry-run rules. Assess tickets using Jira; repository
investigation is limited to the configured public GitHub repositories. Do not
access other repository hosts or their content through shared checkouts. Make
no code changes. Apply fixed CVE labels directly without repository lookups.

### Labels

- `repo:<name>` — which repo the work targets (e.g. `repo:data-pipeline`)
- `obsint-processing` / `ccx-processing` — team labels (same team, both valid)
- `needs-investigation` — needs analysis before implementation
- `glitchtip` — auto-created from GlitchTip error tracking

### What makes a ticket sprint-ready

1. **Clear description** — what needs to happen, why, and where
2. **Repo label** — a `repo:<name>` label so it can be matched to a codebase
3. **Appropriate scope** — completable in one sprint (2 weeks), split if not
4. **Priority set** — not "Undefined"
5. **Acceptance criteria** — nice to have, not required

### CVE Grooming

CVE tickets need three labels so the dev bot can pick them up:
1. `obsint-processing-ai` — the bot pickup label
2. `repo:<name>` — which repo contains the affected component
3. `repo:app-interface` — always added, every CVE fix needs a prod image update

**Parsing CVE summaries**: The format is `CVE-YYYY-NNNNN {Component}: {Package}: {Title}`.
Extract the component (first token after the CVE ID) and look it up in the table below.

#### CVE Component to Repo Mapping

| Component (from CVE summary) | Repo label |
|---|---|
| aggregator | `repo:insights-results-aggregator` |
| data-pipeline | `repo:data-pipeline` |
| notification-writer | `repo:ccx-notification-writer` |
| ocp-advisor-frontend, insights-ocp-advisor | `repo:ocp-advisor-frontend` |
| ccx-messaging | `repo:insights-ccx-messaging` |
| parquet-factory | `repo:parquet-factory` |
| upgrades-inference | `repo:ccx-upgrades-inference` |
| aggregator-cleaner, insights-results-aggregator-cleaner | `repo:insights-results-aggregator-cleaner` |
| smart-proxy | `repo:insights-results-smart-proxy` |
| content-renderer | `repo:insights-content-template-renderer` |
| content-service | `repo:content-service` |
| upgrades-data-eng | `repo:ccx-upgrades-data-eng` |
| notification-service | `repo:ccx-notification-service` |
| insights-behavioral-spec | `repo:insights-behavioral-spec` |
| obsint-mocks | `repo:obsint-mocks` |
| aggregator-exporter | `repo:insights-results-aggregator-exporter` |
| processing-tools | `repo:processing-tools` |
| insights-operator-utils | `repo:insights-operator-utils` |
| ccx-upgrades-inference | `repo:ccx-upgrades-inference` |
| ccx-upgrades-data-eng | `repo:ccx-upgrades-data-eng` |
| ccx-notification-service | `repo:ccx-notification-service` |
| ccx-notification-writer | `repo:ccx-notification-writer` |
| lightspeed-services-ocp/ocp-rules-rhel9 | `repo:rules-containers` (see note below) |
| ocp-rules-rhel9 | `repo:rules-containers` (see note below) |
| lightspeed-services-acm/ocp-rules-rhel9 | `repo:lightspeed-advisor-on-premise-ocp` (see note below) |

Match is case-insensitive. If the component doesn't match any entry, flag as
"unknown component — needs manual mapping" and skip labeling for that ticket.
When several rows could match, prefer the most specific one:
`lightspeed-services-acm/ocp-rules-rhel9` (ACM image) must be matched before
the bare `ocp-rules-rhel9` row (OCP image).

**Note — productized rules images**: `lightspeed-services-ocp/ocp-rules-rhel9`
is the productized OCP rules image, managed in the private GitLab repository
`gitlab.cee.redhat.com/ccx/rules-containers` (built from its `public`
branch). `lightspeed-services-acm/ocp-rules-rhel9` is the ACM recommendations
image, managed in the public GitHub repository
`RedHatInsights/lightspeed-advisor-on-premise-ocp` (built on top of the OCP
rules image). Like `app-interface` and `rules-containers`, the ACM repo is a
known fixed mapping that does not require a repository lookup in this
profile — apply the label directly. Unlike every other CVE component, the
production update for these images is **not** an app-interface MR (they are
released by Konflux and published to registry.redhat.io), so the
`repo:app-interface` label must NOT be added to their tickets.

### Common issues to flag

- **GlitchTip auto-tickets** — often just an error title and a link, no description. Need: error context, which environment, whether it's new or recurring.
- **Missing repo labels** — suggest the likely repo based on the description if you can tell.
- **Stale tickets** — older than 6 months with no activity, flag for review.
- **Vague tickets** — "improve X" without saying what's wrong or what better looks like.
