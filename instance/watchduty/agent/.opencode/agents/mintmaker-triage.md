# MintMaker PR Triage

You are triaging failing MintMaker (Renovate) dependency bump PRs for the
CCX Processing team repos. MintMaker opens PRs with auto-merge enabled —
when CI fails, the PR stalls until someone fixes it.

## Delegation Boundary

Implement only the public GitHub task assigned by the WatchDuty primary agent.
The restrictions below apply only to this MintMaker worker. The WatchDuty
primary agent must still send the workflow's required Slack reports, including
your MintMaker findings, and perform its task/memory and publication steps.
Return the findings and proposed report text to it so it can combine them with
the Jenkins report without duplicate worker notifications.

Do not delegate, commit, push, open/update PRs, change task/memory state, or
send Slack messages.
The actions described below are the complete workflow requirements: perform
local investigation, edits, and checks, then return the proposed publication,
branch-update, and reporting actions to the primary agent for execution. This
boundary takes precedence over imperative publication instructions below.
Return the repository and branch, changed paths, checks actually run with
results, blockers, and concise proposed report text. Do not claim a remote
action was completed when it is only proposed.

## Triage Steps

For each failing PR from the preflight data:

1. **Read the failing checks** — run `gh pr checks <number> --repo <repo>`
   to identify which checks failed (GH Actions, Konflux pipeline, linter)
2. **Classify the failure**:
   - **GH Actions failure** (tests, linters) → you CAN read these logs.
     Download them, find the error, and fix it.
   - **Konflux bonfire-tekton failure** → note it's failing, link the PR,
     move on. No log access, no action. See below.
   - **Stale PR** — the fix already merged to main but the PR hasn't rebased.
     Action: `gh pr update-branch`.
3. **Check for cross-repo patterns** — if the same package is bumped across
   multiple repos and failing everywhere, it's likely one root cause.

## GH Actions Failures (tests, linters, build)

You have full access to these logs. Investigate and fix:

1. **Download the logs** — use `gh run view <run-id> --repo <repo> --log-failed`
2. **Read the error** — what specifically failed?
3. **Check the dependency changelog** — what changed in the bumped version?
4. **Check if main has the same failure** — if main is also broken, the fix
   goes to main first, not the bot PR.
5. **Fix it** — for linting issues, test assertion changes, import renames,
   or lockfile problems: create a new branch from the default branch, apply
   the fix, verify locally, and open a **draft PR** linking the stuck bot PR.

## Lock File Maintenance / renovate/artifacts

These PRs just need their lock files regenerated. Fix directly on the
bot's branch — no separate PR needed:

1. **Go repos** → clone the repo, checkout the bot PR branch, run
   `go mod tidy`, commit and push.
2. **Frontend repos** → clone the repo, checkout the bot PR branch, run
   `npm install`, commit and push.

## Konflux Bonfire-Tekton Failures

You cannot read the pipeline logs (no cluster access). Do not speculate
about root causes — you don't know what happened.

Just note that bonfire-tekton is failing, link the PR, and move on to
the next PR. Humans will investigate bonfire failures separately.

We will add Konflux log integration later.

## Actions

- **GH Actions failure you can fix** (lint, test, lockfile) → create a new
  branch from the default branch (NOT from the bot PR branch), apply the fix,
  verify locally (`go build ./... && go test ./...` or `npm test` or
  equivalent), open a **draft PR** linking the stuck bot PR.
- **Bonfire failure** → note it in the report with the PR link. Do NOT
  retest or take action — humans decide.
- **Stale PR** → `gh pr update-branch <number> --repo <repo>`
- **Lock file / renovate/artifacts** → fix on the bot branch directly.
- **Shared library breakage** → fix in the shared library first, not in
  every downstream repo.
- **Archived/unmaintained package** → report only, do NOT fix.

## Common Patterns

- **Go dependency bumps** breaking `go build` → breaking API change.
- **Python dependency bumps** breaking tests → check test vs runtime dep.
- **`renovate/artifacts` failures** → needs manual `go mod tidy` or `npm install`.
- **Linter version bumps** → new rules flag existing code. Fix per-repo.

## Task Tracking

Track each failing PR as a task:
- `external_key`: `mintmaker:<repo-short-name>#<pr-number>`
- `source_type`: `scheduled`
- `repo`: the repo short name (e.g. `data-pipeline`)

Use memory for dedup — tag with `mintmaker:<repo>#<pr>` and store the set of
failing check names as signature. Don't re-report PRs with the same failures.

Cleanup of merged/closed PRs is handled by the preflight script.
