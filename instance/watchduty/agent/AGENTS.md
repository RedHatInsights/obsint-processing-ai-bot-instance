# Watchduty Instance — Additional Instructions

This instance runs as a scheduled watchduty assistant for the CCX Processing
team. It monitors Jenkins CI jobs and MintMaker dependency bump PRs, sends
Slack reports classifying failures as infrastructure issues or real problems,
and announces Advisor plus MPEX weekly status reports once the Friday-dated
files are published in `openshift-eng/hp-weekly-status`.


## Task Tracking

Always pass `source_type="scheduled"` in all task tool calls (the default is
`"jira"` which is wrong for this workflow).

Task parameters for `task_add`:

**Jenkins:**
- `external_key`: `<job-name>/<first-failing-build>` (e.g.,
  `ccx-external-data-pipeline-prod/7756`). The build number makes each failure
  episode unique — `task_remove` archives but doesn't delete, so reusing just
  the job name would hit the unique constraint when the job fails again later.
- `source_type`: `"scheduled"`
- `repo`: the Jenkins job name (no git repo applies)
- `branch`: empty string `""` (no branch applies)

**MintMaker:**
- `external_key`: `mintmaker:<repo>#<pr-number>` (e.g., `mintmaker:data-pipeline#94`)
- `source_type`: `"scheduled"`
- `repo`: the repo short name
- `branch`: empty string `""`

## Error Dedup

Use memory to track previously reported error signatures. Remove when
the item recovers.

- **Jenkins**: tag `watchduty:jenkins:<job-name>`, signature = failing test
  names + error type. Remove when job recovers.
- **MintMaker**: tag `mintmaker:<repo>#<pr>`, signature = set of failing
  check names. Remove when PR is merged or closed.

## OpenCode Runtime

This profile uses OpenCode with the `rehor-openai` provider. The `watchduty`
primary agent and the `mintmaker-triage` subagent use GPT-6 Luna; the
`message-composer` subagent (Slack message composition and sending) uses
GPT-6.1 Terra so only the formatting work runs on the stronger model.
Follow the native workflow AGENTS.md and the selected native primary agent.
Shared/environment helper scripts remain installed under `.claude/skills/`;
those executable paths are intentional and do not select the Claude runtime.
Use `/home/botuser/data` for persistent task data and `/tmp/opencode` for
temporary files.

The `watchduty` primary agent owns the scheduled cycle, task/memory updates,
Slack reporting decisions, deduplication, and sleep signal. Invoke the native
`mintmaker-triage` subagent only for scoped public GitHub maintenance; inspect
its result before publishing changes or sending notifications. Delegate all
Slack message composition and sending to the native `message-composer`
subagent (GPT-6.1 Terra); hand it the classification results and job
metadata, and it formats and sends the messages via the `/slack-notify`
skill. Use `/home/botuser/repos` for public project checkouts. Workers share
the runner filesystem, so delegate sequentially when they use the same
checkout.
