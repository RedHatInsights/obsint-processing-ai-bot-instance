# Obsint Processing Instance — Additional Instructions

## OpenCode coordinator and specialists

`opencode.json` selects `developer-coordinator`. All model calls in this profile
use Claude through Vertex, including GitHub, Jira, GlitchTip, and private GitLab
work. Keep the existing bot identity and task ownership throughout each workflow.

Select the matching native skill and specialist for each task:

- CVE: load `/cve-workflow`, delegate technical phases to `cve`.
- GlitchTip: load `/glitchtip-workflow`, delegate technical phases to `glitchtip`.
- Go backend: load `/golang-workflow`, delegate technical phases to `golang`.
- Python backend: load `/python-backend-workflow`, delegate technical phases to `python-backend`.
- Frontend maintenance: load `/frontend-maintenance-workflow`, delegate technical phases to `frontend-maintenance`.

Load the matching workflow skill before delegating and again before lifecycle
actions after resuming a task. CVE and GlitchTip workflows take precedence over
generic language workflows. When shared instructions refer to a legacy persona,
use the matching native workflow skill and specialist above; do not read legacy
`personas/` paths. The coordinator owns Jira/task updates, commits, pushes,
PR/MR lifecycle, notifications, deployment checks, and cycle completion.
Specialists investigate, change local files, and test only their assigned phase;
inspect their changes and evidence before acting. Delegate sequentially when
specialists would share a checkout. Maximum delegation depth is one.

Use `/home/botuser/repos` for checkouts, `/home/botuser/data` for persistent task
state, and `/tmp/opencode` for scratch. The runner workspace is
`/home/botuser/app`. Custom helper commands below use the current synced profile
under `/home/botuser/app/data/remote-config/${BOT_CONFIG_PATH}/agent/.opencode/skills`;
`BOT_CONFIG_PATH` must identify this profile. Shared runtime helpers are still
installed under `/home/botuser/app/.claude/skills` by the pinned runner; that is
an operational script path, not Claude instruction discovery.

OpenCode V2 has no LSP runtime. Use repository lint, typecheck/compiler, and test
commands for diagnostics; never claim LSP verification. Browser verification
still requires the configured browser tools to be available.

## Slack Notifications — Shared Destination

All developer-bot notifications use the configured `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` Incoming
Webhook. The same destination receives routine updates and CVE alerts. The
coordinator sends notifications; specialists do not send their own copies.
These rules override inherited plain-text notification examples and automatic
helper messages. CVE timing, mentions, keys, and delivery tracking are defined
in `/cve-workflow` and take precedence over the normal-message rules below.

For **non-CVE** messages, use Slack mrkdwn with an emoji, a bold linked title,
a short summary, and the action needed. For example:

```text
🛠️ *Ready for review: <JIRA-URL|JIRA-KEY>*
*Change:* <one-line summary>
*PR:* <PR-URL|repo#number>
*Next:* Please review the change.
```

Adapt the title to the event: review reminder, help needed, or merged. Include
the Jira link and relevant PR/MR links; for blockers without a PR, link the
affected resource instead. Add brief context or verified test results when
useful. Use actual newlines, not literal `\n`, and keep messages concise.
**Normal notifications must not ping any user, group, or channel**, including
WatchDuty. Treat titles, error text, and summaries as plain text: escape their
`&`, `<`, and `>` characters so copied mention markup cannot trigger a ping.
Construct Slack links separately from verified URLs and labels.

Send through the shared helper with the formatted message as one safely quoted
argument. Never use raw `curl`, direct `slack_notify` MCP calls, or a destination
override:

```bash
SLACK_NOTIFY_MODE=immediate \
  python3 /home/botuser/app/.claude/skills/slack-notify/slack_notify.py \
    "<JIRA-KEY>" "<EVENT-TYPE>" "<FORMATTED-MULTILINE-MESSAGE>"
```

Keep the existing normal event types (`pr_created`, `review_reminder`,
`release_pending`, `needs_help`, `infra_error`) and Jira key so the server's
48-hour cooldown still applies. Inspect the JSON response: only `sent: true`
means delivered; a cooldown is not a new delivery. Missing configuration or a
send failure is reported without exposing the webhook and does not block the
PR lifecycle. Do not bypass cooldowns or try another destination.

Avoid duplicate or unformatted automatic messages:

- For `/post-pr`, run its operations entry point with Slack skipped, then send
  the single formatted `pr_created` notification at the workflow's notification
  step. Do not also send the inherited jira-sprint plain-text example:

  ```bash
  python3 /home/botuser/app/.claude/skills/post-pr/scripts/post_pr_operations.py \
    "<PR-URL>" "<PR-NUMBER>" "<JIRA-KEY>" "<SUMMARY>" --skip slack
  ```

- For non-CVE `/wrap-up`, preserve all production and workflow gates and stage
  the required outcome report, then disable only the helper's automatic send:

  ```bash
  SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="" python3 /home/botuser/app/.claude/skills/wrap-up/wrap_up.py "<JIRA-KEY>" 2>&1
  ```

  After confirming the Jira transition and archive succeeded, send one formatted
  `release_pending` message through the shared helper. If a step failed, follow
  `/wrap-up` recovery and describe only confirmed results; never announce a
  completed transition before it succeeds. Keep the built-in send disabled for
  recovery invocations too. The empty value is command-local, so the separate
  notification command still uses the configured webhook. CVE wrap-up follows
  `/cve-workflow`'s existing notification-before-archive sequence instead.

## CVE PR Notifications — CI Gate (overrides jira-sprint workflow)

For CVE tickets, reload `/cve-workflow` and use `/wait-for-ci` before any
GitHub application PR-ready notification or review reminder.
Only a fresh passing check may authorize a CI-passed message; completed skipped and neutral
jobs count as passing. `/post-pr` must use
`post_pr_operations.py --skip slack`; skip jira-sprint's immediate Slack message.

The skill uses Rehor's proxy clients, task metadata, and instance preflight to
schedule pending checks and retry cooldowns across cycles. Do not sleep/poll for
30 minutes inside a session. Known failures follow the workflow's bounded retry
policy; running CI waits. Closed/merged requests do not get review requests.

**For GitHub PRs, if the skill/helper is missing, crashes, or cannot verify CI, request review
using the workflow's `ci-unverified` template.** State the blocker and request
manual CI verification; do not require the broken helper to succeed. Deduplicate
this fallback separately from later CI-passed messages. Every CVE notification
uses the shared webhook with the WatchDuty mention and the workflow's delivery
tracking.

**App-interface promotion MRs are exempt from the CI notification gate.** Send
the workflow's `production-update` message immediately after MR creation, with
the WatchDuty mention `<!subteam^S043UGRST2L>`. Do not run `/wait-for-ci` or wait
for GitLab CI, and do not claim its CI passed. Use the same direct path for
undelivered promotion notices from earlier cycles. Human review and the
production-before-closure rule below still apply.

## PR Merged — Promote to Prod BEFORE Closing (overrides jira-sprint workflow)

Overrides the workflow's **PR merged** step. A repo PR merge only deploys to
**stage**; production needs a separate app-interface GitLab MR. **The ticket must
not be closed/wrapped up until production is updated.**

When a PR is `MERGED` (Priority 1 "PR merged" and Priority 1.5 triage), before
invoking `/wrap-up`:

For CVE tickets, reload `/cve-workflow` before every `/wrap-up`,
including Priority 1.5. Use its CVE notification and helper invocation rules so
post-merge bookkeeping does not send a duplicate or unformatted Slack message.

- **CVE ticket OR `repo:app-interface` label present** → do NOT `/wrap-up` yet:
  - **Exception — productized rules images** (`lightspeed-services-ocp/ocp-rules-rhel9`,
    repo `rules-containers`, and `lightspeed-services-acm/ocp-rules-rhel9`,
    repo `lightspeed-advisor-on-premise-ocp`): these images have no
    app-interface deployment. Their production gate is the Konflux release
    and publication of the fixed image to `registry.redhat.io` (see
    `/cve-workflow`'s "Productized Rules Images" section and the resolve-cve
    `rules-containers-public.md` / `insights-on-prem-acm.md` references).
    Never create an app-interface MR for them; use the same
    `[PROD-GATE:OPEN]`/`[PROD-GATE:CLEARED]` marker sequence, recording the
    expected published tag (or "not released yet") in place of the MR URL, and
    clear it only once the fixed tag is visible in the Red Hat container
    catalog. For the ACM image, the gate also requires the fixed OCP base
    image tag to be the one referenced by its `Dockerfile` `FROM`.
  - No app-interface MR yet → follow **Production Image Update (app-interface)**
    in `/cve-workflow` (wait for Konflux build → check app-interface
    deployment config → open MR with `glab mr create --repo <app-interface-path>
    --hostname gitlab.cee.redhat.com`). Add attribution note. Transition ticket
    → "Code Review". Task stays `in_progress`. Jira comment with MR link.
  - App-interface MR open, not merged → leave ticket in "Code Review", await merge.
    No `/wrap-up`.
  - App-interface MR merged (production updated) → now invoke `/wrap-up`.
  - App-interface NOT in `agent/project-repos.json` → note in Jira, then `/wrap-up`.
- **Otherwise (no prod promotion needed / production already current)** → invoke
  `/wrap-up` as the workflow describes.

**Gate**: while the app-interface promotion MR is pending (not merged), the ticket
stays "Code Review", NOT closed. Promotion to prod happens **before** the ticket
is closed.

### Safeguard — Self-Ping Marker Comment

The gate above is instruction-only. Reinforce it with a durable, self-recognizable
marker posted to the Jira ticket, so future cycles re-read it and cannot forget.

**When the gate first activates** (PR merged, prod promotion still pending), post a
Jira comment (`jira_add_comment`) containing this exact marker line:

```
🔒 [PROD-GATE:OPEN] {mention} Do NOT close this ticket. Production promotion pending.
app-interface MR: <MR_URL or "not created yet">
Close/`/wrap-up` is allowed ONLY after this MR is merged and production is updated.
```

**Ping the bot itself** via `{mention}` — **only for CVE tickets, where the bot is
the assignee.** Mention the assignee (the bot's own Jira user, `$BOT_JIRA_EMAIL`)
so the reminder notifies the bot on the next cycle. For a non-CVE `repo:app-interface`
ticket the assignee may be a human — do NOT @mention them; drop `{mention}` and post
the marker without a ping (the marker + task metadata still gate the close).

Also record it in task state as backup: `task_update` metadata
`{"prod_gate": "open", "next_step": "await app-interface MR merge",
"app_interface_mr": "<url>"}`.

**Every cycle, before any `/wrap-up` or close/`Release Pending` transition**: scan
the ticket's Jira comments for a `[PROD-GATE:OPEN]` marker (and/or check task
metadata `prod_gate == "open"`). If found → the ticket is gated:
- Do NOT `/wrap-up`, do NOT close. Keep it in "Code Review".
- This marker is a **bot self-assigned task**, NOT resolved feedback — treat it as
  an outstanding action item even though it is a bot-authored comment.

**Clearing the gate** — only when the app-interface MR is merged and production
confirmed updated:
1. Post a Jira comment with `✅ [PROD-GATE:CLEARED] Production updated — safe to close.`
2. `task_update` metadata `{"prod_gate": "cleared"}`.
3. Then proceed to `/wrap-up`.

Never delete or edit the `[PROD-GATE:OPEN]` comment; clear it only by posting the
`[PROD-GATE:CLEARED]` follow-up. Both markers use these exact strings so they stay
machine-recognizable across cycles regardless of the bot/human content heuristic.

## Version Management

This instance has **nvm** (Node) and **goenv** (Go) version managers installed. Use them to match the version required by each repo.

### Node.js (nvm)

Before working on a repo with `package.json`, check its `.nvmrc` or `engines.node` field and switch if needed:

```bash
nvm use          # reads .nvmrc if present
nvm install 20   # install + switch to Node 20
nvm use default  # back to default (22)
```

Default: Node.js 22 LTS. Available globally via `/usr/local/bin/node`.

### Go (goenv)

Before working on a repo with `go.mod`, check the `go` directive and switch if needed:

```bash
goenv versions                    # list installed versions
goenv install 1.23.0              # install a new version
goenv global 1.23.0               # set as default
goenv local 1.24.2                # set for current directory only
```

Pre-installed: Go 1.24.2 (default), 1.25.7. Available globally via `/usr/local/bin/go`.

### When to switch

- `go.mod` says `go 1.23` → `goenv install 1.23.x && goenv local 1.23.x`
- `.nvmrc` says `20` → `nvm use 20` (installs automatically if missing)
- No version file → use the defaults
