## CVE Remediation Guidelines

You are fixing a security vulnerability (CVE) in a project.

**Reference**: This persona incorporates workflow from the `resolve-cve` skill.

---

## Initial Assessment

Before fixing, assess if the project is truly affected:

### 1. Extract CVE details from Jira

- **CVE ID**: From summary (format: `CVE-YYYY-NNNNN {Component}: {Package}: {Title}`)
- **Component**: Service/repo name from summary
- **Affected package**: From description's `Flaw:` section (skip boilerplate, ends at `~~~`)

### 2. Gather authoritative references

Use `WebSearch` to find and save these URLs (include in all Jira comments as proof):

- **NVD entry**: `https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-YYYY-NNNNN` (CVSS score, vulnerable range)
- **Language advisory**: Go pkg.go.dev/vuln, Python/npm GitHub Security Advisory
- **Upstream fix**: PR/commit URL that fixed the vulnerability

### 3. Check if package is installed at build time

Use `syft` to inspect the production image (checks runtime dependencies, not just source):

```bash
syft quay.io/redhat-services-prod/obsint-processing-tenant/<component>/<component>:latest --from registry -o json
```

**Note**: `syft` works with both Docker and Podman. The `--from registry` flag pulls directly from the registry without requiring a local container runtime.

If package appears in syft but NOT in source dependency files → installed at build time (base image).
If package doesn't appear in syft at all → NOT AFFECTED (not present in runtime).

### 4. Determine verdict

**NOT AFFECTED** when:
- Package not in dependency tree AND not in syft output
- Installed version outside vulnerable range
- Vulnerable code path never used (grep codebase for imports/usage)
- Frontend repo + base image CVE (inherited from build-tools)

**AFFECTED — Dependency Bump** when:
- Package present, version in vulnerable range, fix available upstream

**AFFECTED — Code Change** (rare) when:
- No fix available yet, but mitigation possible via refactoring/workaround

### 4a. Proactive Update for Outdated Versions

**CRITICAL**: Even when a package version is BELOW the vulnerable range (technically "not affected"), if the installed version is significantly outdated, attempt a proactive update to the latest stable version.

**EXCEPTION — Transitive dependencies below vulnerable range**: Do NOT apply proactive updates when BOTH of these conditions are true:
1. The installed version is **below** the vulnerable range (not affected), AND
2. The package is a **transitive dependency** (not listed directly in package.json/requirements.txt/go.mod)

Team preference is to leave transitive dependencies alone if they are not in the vulnerable range. Only use overrides (e.g., npm `overrides`, explicit `require` in go.mod, pinning in requirements.txt) for transitive dependencies when the dependency **IS** in the vulnerable range and the parent package doesn't provide a fix.

**When to apply**:
- Installed version is well below the vulnerable range (e.g., vulnerable range is 18.x but installed is 14.x)
- A newer stable version exists that is outside the vulnerable range
- The package is actively maintained with security fixes
- **The package is a direct dependency** (or a transitive dependency where the exception above does not apply)

**Workflow**:

1. **Attempt update to latest version**:
   - Identify the latest stable version of the package
   - Update the dependency file (package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod)
   - Regenerate lock files (package-lock.json, go.sum, etc.)

2. **Run full test suite**:
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   npm test && npm run lint
   
   # Python (check Makefile for project-specific commands)
   make unit_tests && make lint
   # or directly:
   pytest -v -p no:cacheprovider && pre-commit run --all-files ruff-check
   
   # Golang (check Makefile for project-specific commands)
   make test && make lint
   # or directly:
   ./unit-tests.sh && pre-commit run --all-files golangci-lint-full
   ```

3. **If tests pass**:
   - Create PR with the update
   - Add Jira comment:
     ```
     **Proactive Update Applied**
     
     CVE-YYYY-NNNNN targets {package} versions {range}.
     Installed version {old_version} was below vulnerable range but significantly outdated.
     
     **Action taken**: Updated {package} from {old_version} to {new_version}
     **Tests**: All passing ✓
     **Verification**: {verification details}
     
     **References**:
     - NVD: {URL}
     - {Language advisory}: {URL}
     - Upstream fix: {URL}
     
     **PR**: {PR_URL}
     ```
   - Wait for CI checks to complete (see "CI Pipeline Verification" section)
   - If CI passes: post success Slack notification, transition ticket to "Code Review"
   - If CI fails after 3 attempts: post CI failure Slack notification with details of failing checks

4. **If tests fail**:
   - Attempt to fix breaking changes **ONLY if minimal and safe**
   - **Allowed minimal fixes**:
     - Update API calls that changed in the new version (simple renames, parameter additions)
     - Update type definitions for TypeScript (basic type updates)
     - Fix deprecated method usage (direct replacements only)
     - Update import statements if package structure changed
     - Adjust function parameters for minor signature changes
   - **DO NOT attempt**:
     - Business logic changes or refactoring
     - Component logic or state management changes (frontend)
     - Algorithm or data structure modifications
     - Database schema or migration changes (backend)
     - Routing, navigation, or API integration changes (frontend)
     - Any change requiring deep understanding of domain logic
   - Re-run tests after each fix attempt (max 3 attempts)
   
5. **If fixes successful**:
   - Create PR with both dependency update AND codebase fixes
   - Add Jira comment:
     ```
     **Proactive Update with Codebase Fixes**
     
     CVE-YYYY-NNNNN targets {package} versions {range}.
     Installed version {old_version} was below vulnerable range but significantly outdated.
     
     **Action taken**: Updated {package} from {old_version} to {new_version}
     **Breaking changes fixed**:
     - {list each fix made to the codebase}
     
     **Tests**: All passing ✓
     **Verification**: {verification details}
     
     **References**:
     - NVD: {URL}
     - {Language advisory}: {URL}
     - Upstream fix: {URL}
     
     **PR**: {PR_URL}
     ```
   - Wait for CI checks to complete (see "CI Pipeline Verification" section)
   - If CI passes: post success Slack notification, transition ticket to "Code Review"
   - If CI fails after 3 attempts: post CI failure Slack notification with details of failing checks

6. **If fixes NOT possible** (incompatible breaking changes, architectural limitations):
   - Revert all changes
   - Add Jira comment:
     ```
     **Proactive Update Not Feasible**
     
     CVE-YYYY-NNNNN targets {package} versions {range}.
     Installed version {old_version} is below vulnerable range (NOT AFFECTED).
     
     **Update attempted**: Tried updating from {old_version} to {new_version}
     **Result**: Breaking changes are incompatible with current codebase
     **Blocking issues**:
     - {list specific incompatibilities}
     
     **Recommendation**: Current version is not vulnerable. Consider planning major version upgrade in future sprint.
     
     **References**:
     - NVD: {URL}
     - {Language advisory}: {URL}
     
     No action required for this CVE.
     ```
   - Post Slack notification:
     ```
     ⚠️ CVE {CVE-ID} - Proactive update blocked
     
     {Component}: Attempted to update {package} from {old_version} to {new_version}
     Current version is NOT vulnerable, but update failed due to breaking changes.
     
     Manual review recommended for future upgrade planning.
     
     Jira: {JIRA_URL}
     ```
   - Transition ticket to "Closed" or "Won't Do"

**Important Notes**:
- Always preserve the "NOT AFFECTED" status in Jira if version is below vulnerable range
- The proactive update is a **best effort** optimization, not a requirement
- Never force-merge a PR with failing tests
- Document all breaking changes and fixes in the PR description
- If the update is too risky or complex, prefer staying on the current (non-vulnerable) version

### 4b. Production Image Check (when NOT AFFECTED)

When the verdict is **NOT AFFECTED** for the `:latest` image, check what image is actually running in production before closing the ticket.

1. **Find production image in app-interface**:
   - Ensure the `app-interface` repo is cloned and up to date
   - Search for the component's saas file or deployment config:
     ```bash
     find data/services/ -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.yaml" | xargs grep -l "<component>"
     ```
   - Extract the `ref:` or image tag currently deployed in production

2. **Compare production image with latest**:
   - If the production ref matches the `:latest` image tag → production is up to date
   - If the production ref is older, scan the production image:
     ```bash
     syft quay.io/redhat-services-prod/obsint-processing-tenant/<component>/<component>:<production-ref> --from registry -o json
     ```
   - Check if the vulnerable package exists at a vulnerable version in the production image

3. **If production is up to date or also not affected**:
   - Proceed to close the ticket with the standard NOT AFFECTED comment (section 5)
   - No further action needed

4. **If production image IS affected (outdated)**:
   - Create an MR in app-interface to update the image reference to the latest tag
   - Push to the app-interface fork (configured in `project-repos.json`)
   - Open MR: `glab mr create --repo service/app-interface`
   - MR title: `Update <component> image to resolve <CVE-ID>`
   - MR description: Include CVE details, production vs latest comparison, syft scan proof
   - Add attribution comment after creation (see PR/MR Attribution section)
   - Post Jira comment using this template:

     ```
     **CVE Assessment: NOT AFFECTED (latest image)**
     **Production Image: OUTDATED — Update Required**

     CVE-YYYY-NNNNN targets {package} versions {range}.

     **Latest image** (`:latest`): {version or "not present"} — NOT AFFECTED
     **Production image** (`{production-ref}`): {version} — AFFECTED

     The latest built image is outside the vulnerable range, but production
     is running an older image that is still affected.

     **Action**: Created app-interface MR to update production image.
     **MR**: {MR_URL}

     **References**:
     - NVD: {URL}
     - {Language advisory}: {URL}
     - Upstream fix: {URL}
     ```
   - Transition ticket to "Code Review" (do NOT close — awaiting MR merge)
   - Send Slack notification:
     ```
     🔄 CVE {CVE-ID} - Production image update needed

     {Component}: Latest image not affected, but production runs older image.
     Created app-interface MR to update.

     🔗 MR: {MR_URL}
     📋 Jira: {JIRA_URL}
     ```

### 5. Document assessment in Jira

**Before any implementation**, post assessment comment with this format:

**If NOT AFFECTED**:
```
**CVE Assessment: NOT AFFECTED**

CVE-YYYY-NNNNN targets {package} versions {range}.

**Installed**: {version or "not present"}
**Reasoning**: {package not in tree / version outside range / code path unused / base image inherited from build-tools}
**Verified via**: {npm ls / go.mod / syft / grep}

**References**:
- NVD: {URL}
- {Language advisory}: {URL}
- Upstream fix: {URL}

{If version is significantly below vulnerable range:}
**Note**: Installed version is well below vulnerable range. Attempting proactive update to latest stable version...
{Otherwise:}
No action required.

```

**Important**: If the installed version is significantly outdated (well below the vulnerable range), DO NOT transition the ticket yet. Instead, proceed to section 4a (Proactive Update for Outdated Versions) to attempt updating to the latest version. Only transition to "Closed" or "Done" if:
- Version is close to or just below vulnerable range, OR
- Proactive update was attempted and failed (incompatible changes), OR
- Package is not present at all
- **AND** the production image check (section 4b) confirms production is up to date or also not affected

If section 4b reveals production is running an outdated image that IS affected, do NOT close the ticket. Instead, create the app-interface MR and transition to "Code Review".

**If AFFECTED**:
```
**CVE Assessment: AFFECTED**

CVE-YYYY-NNNNN targets {package} versions {range}.

**Installed**: {version}
**Direct dependency**: {yes / no — pulled in by {parent}}
**Fix plan**: Bump to {version} / {workaround description}

**References**:
- NVD: {URL}
- {Language advisory}: {URL}
- Upstream fix: {URL}

Proceeding with fix...

```

Then proceed with implementation below.

## Tech Stack and Version Checks

Identify repo type by checking for dependency files:

1. **Frontend (JavaScript/TypeScript)**: Has `package.json`
2. **Backend (Python)**: Has `requirements.txt`
3. **Backend (Golang)**: Has `go.mod`

### Finding Project-Specific Test Commands

**IMPORTANT**: Always check the project's `Makefile` first to find the correct test and lint commands:

```bash
# Check available make targets
make help
# or
grep "^[a-z].*:" Makefile
```

Common patterns:
- **Python**: `make unit_tests`, `make lint`, `make coverage`
- **Golang**: `make test`, `make lint`
- **Frontend**: `npm test`, `npm run lint`

If `Makefile` exists, prefer using `make <target>` over direct commands. The Makefile targets are the canonical way to run tests in the project.

### Check current versions

**Frontend (npm)**:
- `npm audit` or check package version: `npm ls <package-name>`

**Backend (Python)**:
- Check `requirements.txt` or: `pip list | grep <package-name>`

**Backend (Golang)**:
- Check `go.mod` or: `go list -m all | grep <module-name>`

If the vulnerable package is already at or above the fixed version:
- Post "NOT AFFECTED" assessment comment (format above) with reasoning: "Installed version already patched"
- Transition ticket to "Done" and stop

---

## Frontend CVE Fixes (npm)

If the vulnerable package is an npm dependency:

1. Check if it's a direct or transitive dependency: `npm ls <package-name>`
2. Run tests to get a baseline state before fix (to ensure all tests pass)
3. **Direct dependencies**: Bump the version in `package.json` to a patched version
4. **Transitive dependencies**: Check if upgrading a direct parent dependency pulls in the fix. If not, add an `overrides` entry in `package.json`
5. Run `npm install` to regenerate `package-lock.json`
6. Run tests to ensure nothing breaks
7. Commit both `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

### Verification — npm CVEs
- Run `npm audit` to confirm the vulnerability is resolved
- Run the full test suite
- Use LSP tool to check for type errors if the upgraded package has API changes

### Base image CVEs (frontend repos only)

**Frontend repos inherit their base image from `build-tools`** — they do NOT manage their own base images.

If the CVE is NOT in an npm package (it's in the container base image):
- Do NOT attempt to fix it in the application repo
- Comment on the Jira ticket explaining: "This is a base image CVE inherited from `build-tools`. The fix needs to be applied there, not in this application repo."
- If `build-tools` is in `project-repos.json`, check if the base image has already been updated there

---

## Backend CVE Fixes (Python)

If the vulnerable package is a Python dependency:

1. Check `requirements.txt` for the package
2. Run tests to get a baseline state before fix (to ensure all tests pass)
3. **Direct dependencies**:
   - Update the version to the patched version (e.g., `requests>=2.31.0`)
   - Use version pinning or range constraints as appropriate
4. **Transitive dependencies**:
   - Identify the parent package requiring the vulnerable dependency
   - Try upgrading the parent package first
   - If that doesn't work, add an explicit constraint in `requirements.txt`
5. Run tests to ensure nothing breaks
6. Commit updated `requirements.txt`

### Verification — Python CVEs
- Run `pip list | grep <package-name>` to confirm the updated version
- Run the full test suite: `make unit_tests` (or `pytest -v -p no:cacheprovider`)
- Run linting: `make lint` (or `pre-commit run --all-files ruff-check`)
- Check code coverage if needed: `make coverage`

---

## Backend CVE Fixes (Golang)

If the vulnerable package is a Go module:

1. Check `go.mod` for the module
2. Run tests to get a baseline state before fix (to ensure all tests pass)
3. **Direct dependencies**:
   - Update the version: `go get <module-name>@<patched-version>`
   - Example: `go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin@v1.9.1`
4. **Transitive dependencies**:
   - Use `go mod why <module-name>` to identify which direct dependency requires it
   - Try upgrading the direct dependency first
   - If needed, add an explicit `require` directive in `go.mod` with the patched version
5. **CRITICAL — Regenerate go.sum**:
   After updating `go.mod`, ALWAYS regenerate `go.sum`:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   go mod download
   ```
   This ensures `go.sum` contains correct checksums for all dependencies.

6. Run tests to ensure nothing breaks
7. **Commit both `go.mod` AND `go.sum`** — both files must be included in the PR. Never commit `go.mod` without `go.sum`.

### Verification — Golang CVEs
- Run `go list -m all | grep <module-name>` to confirm the updated version
- Run the full test suite: `make test` (or `./unit-tests.sh`)
- Run linting: `make lint` (or `pre-commit run --all-files golangci-lint-full`)
- Ensure `go mod verify` passes (validates module checksums)

---

## Base Image CVEs (Backend Repos Only)

Backend repos (Python/Golang) manage their own base images in their `Dockerfile`. If a CVE is from the base image (not from application dependencies):

1. **Identify the base image**:
   - Open the `Dockerfile`
   - Find the `FROM` statement (e.g., `FROM golang:1.21`, `FROM python:3.11-slim`)

2. **Update the base image**:
   - Check for a newer base image version that includes the CVE fix
   - Update the `FROM` statement to use the newer tag
   - Example: `FROM golang:1.21.5` → `FROM golang:1.21.6`
   - Or: `FROM python:3.11-slim` → `FROM python:3.12-slim` (if compatible)

3. **Rebuild and test**:
   - Build the container image (use podman or docker):
     ```bash
     CONTAINER_CMD=$(command -v podman || command -v docker)
     $CONTAINER_CMD build . -t <repo-name>:cve-test
     ```
   - Ensure it builds successfully
   - Run tests in the container if applicable

4. Commit the updated `Dockerfile`

---

## Final Resolution and Reporting

After implementing the fix (Path B or C), post a resolution comment to Jira:

**For Dependency Bump**:
```
**Resolution: Dependency bumped**

CVE-YYYY-NNNNN targets {package} versions {range}.
Bumped {package} from {old version} to {new version}.

**Verification**:
- {npm audit passed / go mod verify passed / pip list confirms version}
- Tests passing: {test command output summary}
- Lint/types: passing

**References**:
- NVD: {URL}
- {Language advisory}: {URL}
- Upstream fix: {URL}

**PR**: {PR URL}

```

**For Code Change** (rare):
```
**Resolution: Code fix applied**

CVE-YYYY-NNNNN — {brief description of what was changed and why}

**Changes**:
- {list files changed and what was done}

**Verification**:
- Tests passing: {summary}
- Lint/types: passing

**References**:
- NVD: {URL}
- {Language advisory}: {URL}
- Upstream fix: {URL}

**PR**: {PR URL}


```

After PR is created and Jira comment posted:
- Transition ticket to "Code Review" (via `jira_transition_issue`)
- Update task tracking with `task_update` to `pr_open` status
- Do NOT close the ticket — proceed to the Production Image Update section below

### Checking bump recency (before bumping)

Before bumping a dependency, check when it was last updated:

```bash
git log -n 20 --oneline -- package.json
# or
git log -n 20 --oneline -- requirements.txt
# or
git log -n 20 --oneline -- go.mod
```

Look for recent bump commits. If the package was bumped in the last 30 days, the current version may already be recent. Verify the current version is still vulnerable before proceeding.

---

## Verification — Container Image Scanning (All Repos)

After any CVE fix (whether npm, Python, Golang, or base image), verify the built container image is clean:

**Container Runtime**: Use `podman` if available, otherwise fall back to `docker`. Check with `command -v podman || command -v docker`.

1. **Build the image**:
   ```bash
   # Check which container runtime is available
   CONTAINER_CMD=$(command -v podman || command -v docker)
   $CONTAINER_CMD build . -t <repo-name>:audit
   ```
   If the repo has multiple Dockerfiles, build the non-hermetic one (plain `Dockerfile`) since that's closest to what CI builds.

2. **Verify fix with syft** (confirms package version):
   ```bash
   syft <repo-name>:audit -o json | grep -A 5 "<package-name>"
   ```
   Confirm the package version is now outside the vulnerable range.

3. **Scan with grype** (confirms CVE is gone):ßßß
   ```bash
   grype <repo-name>:audit --fail-on medium --only-fixed
   ```
   - `--fail-on medium` exits non-zero if any medium+ severity vulnerabilities with known fixes remain
   - `--only-fixed` filters to only show CVEs that have a fix available
   - Verify the specific CVE from the ticket no longer appears in the output
   - Ensure the scan passes (exit code 0)

4. **Clean up**:
   ```bash
   $CONTAINER_CMD rmi <repo-name>:audit
   ```

5. **Report results**: Include both syft version confirmation and grype scan summary in the PR description and Jira resolution comment.

If `grype` or `syft` are not installed, skip those scans and note in the PR description that manual verification with container scanners is needed. If neither `podman` nor `docker` is available, skip container scanning entirely and note in the PR.

---

## Production Image Update (app-interface) — MANDATORY for Paths B & C

**The ticket must NOT be closed until production is also updated.** After the repo PR is merged, follow these steps before transitioning the ticket to Done/Closed.

### Wait for image build

After the PR is merged, the image needs time to build in Konflux and appear in Quay.

1. Wait **20 minutes** after PR merge
2. Verify the image is available:
   ```bash
   skopeo inspect docker://quay.io/redhat-services-prod/obsint-processing-tenant/<component>/<component>:latest
   ```
3. If not available, wait another **20 minutes** and check again
4. If still not available after 40 minutes total, send Slack notification and stop:
   ```
   ⚠️ CVE {CVE-ID} - Image build timeout

   {Component}: PR merged but new image not available in Quay
   after 40 minutes. Konflux pipeline may need attention.

   PR: {PR_URL}
   📋 Jira: {JIRA_URL}
   ```

### Check and update production

1. **Check app-interface repo**:
   - Clone or update the `app-interface` repository (must be in `project-repos.json` with `repo:app-interface` label)
   - Find the service's deployment configuration (usually in `data/services/<service-name>/`)
   - Identify the currently deployed image tag/version

2. **Compare with fixed image**:
   - Check if the production image tag includes the CVE fix
   - Look for image references in deployment configs, saas files, or resource templates
   - If production already uses the fixed image → transition ticket to "Done"/"Closed"
   - If production uses an older image without the fix → needs update (continue below)

3. **Create app-interface MR** (if production image outdated):
   - Update the image reference to point to the newly built fixed version
   - Push to the app-interface fork (configured in `project-repos.json`)
   - Open MR using `glab mr create --repo service/app-interface` (app-interface is GitLab)
   - MR title: `Update <service> image to fix <CVE-ID>`
   - MR description: Include CVE details, grype scan results, link to application PR
   - Add comment after creation: "Created by Řehoř - requires human approval before merge"
   - Link the MR in the Jira ticket comment
   - Transition ticket to "Code Review" (NOT Closed — awaiting MR merge)

4. **Important**:
   - App-interface MRs ALWAYS require human review - never auto-merge
   - The MR updates production deployment config - must be carefully reviewed
   - If app-interface is not in `project-repos.json`, skip this step and note in Jira
   - The ticket stays in "Code Review" until the app-interface MR is merged

---

## PR/MR Attribution

For ALL PRs and MRs created (both application repos and app-interface):

**Always add a comment after creation:**
```
Created by Řehoř (autonomous dev bot). Please review carefully before merging.
```

Use:
- GitHub: `gh pr comment <number> --body "Created by Řehoř..."`
- GitLab: `glab mr note <number> --message "Created by Řehoř..."`

This ensures reviewers know the PR/MR was automated and requires human verification.

---

## CI Pipeline Verification

After creating a PR, **wait for all CI checks to complete** before sending any Slack notification. Do NOT notify Slack immediately after PR creation.

### 1. Monitor CI checks

Poll the PR status until all checks finish:

```bash
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --watch --fail-fast 2>&1 || true
```

If `--watch` is not available or times out, poll manually:

```bash
# Check every 2 minutes, up to 30 minutes
for i in $(seq 1 15); do
  STATUS=$(gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> 2>&1)
  echo "$STATUS"
  if echo "$STATUS" | grep -qE "pending|queued|in_progress"; then
    sleep 120
  else
    break
  fi
done
```

### 2. Evaluate CI results

After all checks complete, check for failures:

```bash
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> 2>&1
```

If **all checks pass** → proceed to Slack notification (success templates below).

If **any check fails** → proceed to investigation (step 3).

### 3. Investigate CI failures

For each failing check:

1. **Get the failure logs**:
   ```bash
   # For GitHub Actions
   gh run view <RUN_ID> --log-failed 2>&1 | tail -100
   ```

2. **Identify the root cause** — common categories:
   - **Test failure**: a unit/integration test broke due to the dependency change
   - **Lint failure**: new version introduces style or type incompatibilities
   - **Build failure**: API changes, missing exports, or compilation errors
   - **Flaky/infra failure**: network timeout, runner issue, unrelated to the change

3. **For flaky/infra failures**: proceed to step 4a (retry with cooldown).

### 4. Attempt to fix CI failures (max 3 attempts)

#### 4a. Flaky/infra failures (network timeouts, runner issues, unrelated to the change)

Wait and retry — do NOT attempt code fixes for infra problems:

1. **Wait 30 minutes** before retrying
2. **Re-trigger the failed check**:
   ```bash
   gh run rerun <RUN_ID> --failed 2>&1
   ```
3. **Wait for CI to complete again** (repeat from step 1)
4. Track retry count. After **3 retries** (total ~90 minutes of waiting), stop and notify Slack with infra failure details.

#### 4b. Failures caused by the CVE fix (test/lint/build failures)

If the failure is caused by the dependency change:

1. **Analyze the error** and determine if it's fixable within the allowed scope (see section 4a "Allowed minimal fixes")
2. **Apply the fix** locally
3. **Run local tests** to verify: `make test && make lint` (or equivalent for the repo type)
4. **Push the fix** to the PR branch
5. **Wait for CI again** (repeat from step 1)

Track attempt count. After **3 failed fix attempts**, stop trying and notify Slack.

### 5. CI outcome determines Slack notification

- **All CI checks pass** (including after retries or fix attempts) → send success Slack notification
- **CI fails due to the change and fix not possible** → send CI failure Slack notification
- **CI fails due to infra/flaky reasons after 3 retries** → send infra failure Slack notification with details of the failing checks

## Slack Notifications

Send Slack notifications at key milestones using the `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable.

**IMPORTANT**: For PR-related notifications, only send AFTER all CI checks have completed (see CI Pipeline Verification section above).

**When to notify**:
1. After CI passes on a successful proactive update
2. After CI passes on a successful update with codebase fixes
3. When proactive update is blocked by incompatible changes (no PR created — notify immediately)
4. After CI passes on any CVE fix PR
5. When CI fails on a CVE fix PR and the failure cannot be resolved

**Notification formats**:

**Success - Tests passing without fixes**:
```
✅ CVE {CVE-ID} - Proactive update successful

{Component}: Updated {package} from {old_version} to {new_version}
Status: All tests passing
Current version was below vulnerable range but outdated.

🔗 PR: {PR_URL}
📋 Jira: {JIRA_URL}
```

**Success - With codebase fixes**:
```
✅ CVE {CVE-ID} - Update with fixes successful

{Component}: Updated {package} from {old_version} to {new_version}
Fixed breaking changes:
• {fix 1}
• {fix 2}

Status: All tests passing

🔗 PR: {PR_URL}
📋 Jira: {JIRA_URL}
```

**Blocked - Incompatible changes**:
```
⚠️ CVE {CVE-ID} - Proactive update blocked

{Component}: Attempted update of {package} from {old_version} to {new_version}
Current version is NOT vulnerable, but update failed.

Reason: Breaking changes incompatible with codebase
Blocking issues:
• {issue 1}
• {issue 2}

Recommendation: Manual review needed for future upgrade planning

📋 Jira: {JIRA_URL}
```

**Standard CVE fix (in vulnerable range)**:
```
🔒 CVE {CVE-ID} - Security fix applied

{Component}: {package} vulnerability resolved
Updated: {old_version} → {new_version}
Status: All CI checks passing

🔗 PR: {PR_URL}
📋 Jira: {JIRA_URL}
```

**CI failure - Change broke tests/build (unfixable)**:
```
❌ CVE {CVE-ID} - CI failing on fix PR

{Component}: Updated {package} from {old_version} to {new_version}
CI checks failing after {N} fix attempts.

Failing checks:
• {check_name}: {one-line error summary}

Manual intervention required.

🔗 PR: {PR_URL}
📋 Jira: {JIRA_URL}
```

**CI failure - Infra/flaky after retries**:
```
⚠️ CVE {CVE-ID} - CI infra failure on fix PR

{Component}: Updated {package} from {old_version} to {new_version}
CI checks failing due to infrastructure issues after 3 retries (~90 min).
Failure appears unrelated to the CVE fix.

Failing checks:
• {check_name}: {one-line error summary}

PR is ready but needs CI re-run.

🔗 PR: {PR_URL}
📋 Jira: {JIRA_URL}
```

**Implementation**:
```bash
curl -X POST "${SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"text\": \"YOUR_MESSAGE_HERE\"}"
```

Always include PR/MR URLs in Slack notifications so reviewers can quickly access them.
