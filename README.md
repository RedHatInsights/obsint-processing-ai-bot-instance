# obsint-processing-ai-bot-instance

Three [Řehoř](https://github.com/OpenShift-Fleet/rehor) bot profiles serve the CCX
Processing team: developer-bot implements Jira work, WatchDuty monitors CI and
MintMaker PRs, and backlog-groomer assesses Jira tickets and prepares CVE work.

For ticket assignment and operating guidance, see [CCX Docs — agents](https://ccx.pages.redhat.com/ccx-docs/docs/processing/agents/).
The shared [dashboard](https://devbot-memory-server-platform-frontend-ai-dev-stage.apps.rosa.hcmais01ue1.s9m2.p3.openshiftapps.com/#/instances)
shows task progress and bot activity.

## Runtime and model selection

All profiles use native OpenCode V2 through the coordinator execution engine.
The `dev-bot` submodule pins the merged runtime at
`e6b0fda738c71b8be694b8711cf32e53eee59c9b` (OpenCode CLI/client 2.1.2).

| Profile | Provider and model | Work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `instance/developer-bot` | Vertex: Claude Opus 4.6; Sonnet 4.6 utility model | Jira implementation, public GitHub, private GitLab/app-interface, CVEs, GlitchTip |
| `instance/watchduty` | OpenAI Responses: GPT-6 Luna, medium reasoning | Jenkins monitoring and public GitHub MintMaker maintenance |
| `instance/backlog-groomer` | OpenAI Responses: GPT-6 Luna, medium reasoning | Scheduled Jira backlog assessment and CVE grooming |

Provider selection is per profile. Developer-bot stays on Vertex throughout a
task, including production promotion; there is no cross-provider task handoff.
The OpenAI profiles are scoped to Jira grooming, configured Jenkins monitoring,
and public GitHub repositories. Other repository hosts and their content in
shared checkouts are outside their scope. Backlog-groomer applies the fixed
`repo:app-interface` Jira label for CVEs without a repository mapping or lookup.

Native agent roles and delegation permissions do not create separate OS
sandboxes. WatchDuty's primary agent owns task/memory updates, Slack reporting,
and publication; its MintMaker worker returns scoped local work and evidence.
Developer-bot's coordinator likewise owns lifecycle/publication and delegates
technical work to its domain specialists. Workers cannot recursively delegate.

## Configuration and native resources

Each profile has the following structure:

```text
instance/<profile>/
├── opencode-deployment.json       # Image-owned provider/models and directory grants
└── agent/
    ├── instance.yaml             # Workflow, runtime, provider, model, environments
    ├── AGENTS.md                 # Instance instructions
    ├── opencode.json             # Primary agent and native delegation settings
    ├── project-repos.json        # Repository keys, upstream/fork URLs, host
    ├── mcp.json                  # Optional instance MCP endpoints
    ├── .opencode/
    │   ├── agents/*.md           # Native primary/subagent definitions
    │   ├── instructions/         # Optional coordinator lifecycle instructions
    │   └── skills/<name>/        # SKILL.md, scripts, and reference data
    ├── preflight/                # Optional deterministic instance preflights
    └── workflows/<name>/         # Optional custom workflow AGENTS.md and preflights
```

Remote config sync refreshes the selected `agent/` profile each cycle. Native
resources replace legacy persona prompt directories and Claude instruction
assembly. Deterministic Python preflights still run before model sessions.
Add native agents with V2 YAML frontmatter (`description`, `mode`, `model`, and
ordered `permissions`); update delegation rules when adding a worker. Add local
skills under `.opencode/skills/<name>/` with `name` and `description` frontmatter.

Custom helper scripts run from the synced profile, for example:

```text
/home/botuser/app/data/remote-config/${BOT_CONFIG_PATH}/agent/.opencode/skills/
```

Shared/workflow/environment helpers are still installed by Řehoř under
`.claude/skills/`. Commands such as
`python3 .claude/skills/slack-notify/slack_notify.py ...` deliberately retain that
path; it does not select the Claude runtime. The OpenCode shell restores normal
XDG homes, so custom scripts must not assume the shell's XDG directory is the
native resource staging directory.

Developer-bot's [/wait-for-ci](instance/developer-bot/agent/.opencode/skills/wait-for-ci/SKILL.md)
retains the GitHub CI notification gate and deferred retry behavior. App-interface
promotion MRs send the separate production-update review request immediately;
human review/merge and production verification remain required before closure.

## Image and deployment

Both Konflux pipelines in `.tekton/` build the unmodified upstream
[Dockerfile.runner](dev-bot/Dockerfile.runner) from the repository root.

Developer-bot uses the supported `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` for both ordinary updates
and CVE alerts. App-interface maps it to the existing
`ctibor-cve-watchduty-slack-webhook` secret. The shared memory-server sends
incoming app webhooks a `text` payload; developer-bot composes Slack mrkdwn
titles, labelled links, summaries, and next actions directly. Ordinary updates
have no mentions; CVE alerts retain the WatchDuty group mention and their CI
and production gates. Shared helpers' automatic Slack messages are suppressed
where a formatted lifecycle message is composed, avoiding duplicate sends.
The scheduled WatchDuty profile retains its own existing webhook.

Notifications use immediate mode. Daily digest scheduling is not enabled;
the pinned memory-server's digest sender uses the workflow-specific `msg`
payload and would need incoming-webhook support before enabling digests here.

GlitchTip's helper derives the selected proxy hostname from `EXECUTOR_ADDR`
and connects to port 8448. Its organization defaults to `ccx`; the existing
team proxy supplies the upstream URL and authentication token. This setup needs
no runtime patch, private webhook file, or new Vault credentials.

The push pipeline publishes the instance image; PR images expire after five
days. Production image/template references are managed by
[app-interface's obsint-deploy.yaml](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/data/services/insights/platform-frontend-ai-dev/obsint-deploy.yaml).
Its existing bot targets supply `BOT_CONFIG_PATH` and the team `PROXY_NAME`.

The [bot template](deploy/template.yaml) sets:

```text
BOT_EXECUTION_ENGINE=coordinator
REHOR_OPENCODE_DEPLOYMENT_CONFIG=/home/botuser/app/${BOT_CONFIG_PATH}/opencode-deployment.json
REHOR_OPENCODE_MAX_TOOL_CALLS=200
REHOR_WORKSPACE_OWNER_UID=1000
REHOR_VERTEX_PROXY_URL=http://${PROXY_NAME}:8443
REHOR_MODEL_PROXY_URL=http://${PROXY_NAME}:8450/v1
REHOR_MODEL_PROXY_TOKEN=rehor-runtime
```

The last value is a non-secret client placeholder. Model-provider credentials
remain in the proxy, sourced from Vault-backed Secrets. The
[team proxy template](deploy/proxy-template.yaml) defaults `OPENAI_ALLOWED_MODELS`
to `gpt-6-luna`; the existing proxy Secret must contain a usable OpenAI key.
Vertex must allow both `claude-opus-4-6` and `claude-sonnet-4-6`. NetworkPolicy
permits the corresponding proxy ports, 8443 and 8450. Memory remains shared;
GlitchTip keeps its separate team Secret and proxy endpoint.

The current GitOps proxy pin (`56fe0e6...`) predates OpenAI support. The companion
app-interface MR upgrades it to the released proxy
`e6b0fda738c71b8be694b8711cf32e53eee59c9b` and explicitly allows Luna, using the
existing provider credentials. The registry manifest was verified as
`sha256:cb95369189e9f373c33174799ce5ac64e3f14614bbdee9f4fc429c2385581005`.

## Paired rollout and rollback

Publishing profiles to the tracked config branch can affect an old runner on
its next cycle. A profile update or restart cannot install OpenCode V2 or the
baked provider configuration.

1. Pause all three bots, drain active cycles, and hold KEDA scheduling before
   applying the companion app-interface update. It changes the developer-bot
   webhook mapping as well as the proxy; old profiles still expect the separate
   CVE variable. Record the prior immutable
   image, template settings, compatible config revision, and runtime selection.
2. Merge and deploy the companion app-interface proxy and webhook update first,
   keeping the bots paused until the matching runner and profiles are deployed.
3. Merge this migration and build a fresh image from the pinned submodule.
   Reconcile the released image, template, and matching
   profiles together. Use fresh runner filesystems to avoid stale merged config.
4. Run a controlled staging `--once` cycle for each profile. Check the effective
   provider/model, native primary/delegation, custom/shared helpers, MCP access,
   notification routing, task state, transcript, usage, and child-process cleanup.
   Confirm developer-bot's CI/promotion gates and scheduled dedup behavior.
5. Resume scheduling only after those profile-specific gates pass.

For rollback, pause/drain and hold scheduling again. Restore the previous
Claude-compatible tracked config revision, immutable image, and template/engine
settings together, then start fresh runners and verify them before resuming.
An image-only rollback leaves incompatible remotely synced OpenCode profiles.
Retain Vertex credentials and the previous image throughout the rollback window.

## Local validation

Initialize the pinned submodule and use Node 22 or newer plus the upstream
Python dependencies. Run these checks from the repository root:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
npm --prefix dev-bot/coordinator ci
npm --prefix dev-bot/coordinator run build
npm --prefix dev-bot/coordinator run typecheck
npm --prefix dev-bot/coordinator test -- test/opencode-config.test.ts test/opencode-project-config.test.ts test/opencode-frontmatter.test.ts test/runner.test.ts test/deployment-config.test.ts
python3 -m unittest discover -s instance/watchduty/agent/workflows/watchduty/tests -v
git diff --check
```

Local validation covers coordinator configuration/rendering, native definitions,
helper resolution, and environment compatibility. It does not establish a successful Linux
image build, real provider access, MCP connectivity, or live deployment behavior.
Use the staging gates above and the pinned [Řehoř migration guide](https://github.com/OpenShift-Fleet/rehor/blob/e6b0fda738c71b8be694b8711cf32e53eee59c9b/docs/migrations/opencode-migration.md)
for those checks.
